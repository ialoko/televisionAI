The goal is to analyze information about TV shows and predict wether or not they are streaming on Netflix. 

In order to meet this goal, we used the power of artificial intelligence to perform a classification empirical study and document it in Google colab using Python.

This classification empirical study will use the "Netflix Disney+ Prime Video Hulu Shows Collection" dataset from Kaggle to explore 3 classification algorithms (Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression and Multi-layer Perceptron). We trained our models on the dataset, tested our models and analysed the obtained results quantitavely using precision/recall measures.
